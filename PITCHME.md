@title[What are PWAs]

@quote[Progressive web apps use **modern web APIs** along with traditional **progressive enhancement** strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps **work everywhere** and provide several features that give them the **same user experience** advantages as **native apps**.]([Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps))

@title[PWA Checklist]

### PWA Checklist

#VSLIDE

Some important PWA features:

- Responsive

- App like

- Installable

- Safe

- Offline first

#VSLIDE

- Requires HTTPS!

- Core feature of a PWA

- Used to cache the PWA on the client side (can do a whole lot more)

@title[IndexedDB]

### IndexedDB

- Client side NoSQL database to store data from the server offline

- Can be accessed from inside the Service Worker (sync. storage like localStorage not)

- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org) is a great way to get startet fast and easy (recommanded by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to lower the barriers)

#HSLIDE
@title[Push Notifications]
